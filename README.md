Android app to download and install [a large set of Sanskrit (and other) dictionaries](https://github.com/indic-dict), which can then be used from any compatible dictionary app.

## For library users
- We publish to a [downloaderFlow bintray package](https://bintray.com/sanskrit-coders/android-repo/downloaderFlow).

### Usage
```
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.sanskrit-coders:downloaderFlow:0.0.2@aar'
    // Somehow, dependencies from the above are not automatically deduces (despite downloaderFlow-0.0.2.pom containing them). Hence reincluding them below.
    implementation group: 'com.google.guava', name: 'guava', version: '27.0.1-android'
    implementation('com.loopj.android:android-async-http:1.4.9')
    implementation('org.apache.commons:commons-compress:1.14')
}
repositories {
    ...
    maven {
        url 'https://dl.bintray.com/sanskrit-coders/android-repo'
    }
}
```

## For code contributors
- See comment in MainActivity.kt for a rough understanding of the code.
  - Why do we use java rather than kotlin as source directory? Intellij and android studio don't work optimally otherwise - no autocomplete.
- Review notifications setup: https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/138230?hl=en
- Debugging
  - Parsing adb logcat:
    - Use a good log viewer like `lnav Downloads/logcat.txt`
    - Look for lines with string "****************" to get an idea of when activity lifecycle methods are called.
- Generating dependency tree:
  - `gradle app:dependencies > dep_tree_android.txt`
  - `gradle -q dependencies app:dependencies --configuration compile > dep_tree.txt`

### Publishing to maven
- Build a new version of the aar package by updating libraryVersion in build.gradle and using gradle tasks- assemble.
- Publication location described above.

## For dictionary contributors
* Just open an issue in the most appropriate project (stardict-sanskrit, stardict-hindI, stardict-kannada, stardict-pAlI, stardict-tamiL, stardict-telugu), or if there is no match, in this project.

### To contribute new dictionary repositories
* We will just need to list your dictionary repository in <dictioanryIndices.md>. Open an issue in this project.
* Creating your dictionary repository:
  * Just follow the pattern you observe in, say [this repo](<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/indic-dict/stardict-sanskrit/master/sa-head/tars/tars.MD>).
  * Note that the filename of your dictionary should have two parts, separated by __, as in `kRdanta-rUpa-mAlA__2016-02-20_23-22-27`.
    * The first part should be the actual dictionary name, the second the timestamp.
  * All stardict and other dictionary files should have names matching the dictionary name specified above.
